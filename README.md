### Overview
Our program simulates a day of drone deliveries. First, it asks the user to enter a number to start the simulation. Then, the code directs the drone to deliver packages to different locations based on a set of conditions written in the code. Depending on those conditions, each delivery is marked as either completed successfully, delayed, or failed. Finally, once the simulation is over, it displays a summary of the day, which shows the total counts for successful, delayed, and failed deliveries, along with the drone's remaining battery.
### Execution Instructions
First of all the programm shows Welcome messege and ask the user to enter any number to continue. As the user enter a numbr the code runs and start the delivery simulator and deliver to three locations "A" "B" "C" 
### Team Collaboration Summary
Our team began by reviewing the code together .After this initial planning, Vishal took charge of designing the core logic and
creating a detailed flowchart. While he was doing that,Mohsin set up the project's infrastructure by making the Git repository
and writing the README file. Once the logic and setup were complete, the entire team worked collectively to write the code and
then thoroughly tested it together to ensure it was working properly.

### AI Tool Reflection
We used Chatgpt for Debugging.
### Future Improvements
If we knew Arrays the code would have become easier and smaller. also the logic could have build easier.
